# JOB Seeker Analysis

This project contains SQL scripts for analysing job seeker data, job filings and application patterns.

## Overview  
The main script `JOB_seeker_analysis.sql` performs exploratory analysis of job listings, applications and candidate data. It helps you discover:

- Number of applications per job-listing and per candidate  
- Breakdown of job listings by category, role, location (if available)  
- Candidate application behaviour and trends  
- Insights into skills/experience vs application success (where data allows)
